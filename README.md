# Task 1 – Understanding Cyber Security Basics & Attack Surface

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my submission for **Task 1: Understanding Cyber Security Basics & Attack Surface**.  
The goal of this task was to build a strong foundational understanding of cybersecurity concepts, attacker models, attack surfaces, and common application vulnerabilities, with real-world examples from banking and social media platforms.

The final deliverable is a **comprehensive, research-oriented PDF** that explains concepts in clear, structured, and professional language.

## 🎯 Objectives of the Task
- Understand the **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
- Identify and analyze **different types of cyber attackers**
- Learn about **attack surfaces** across modern technologies
- Study the **OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities** and why they are dangerous
- Map **daily-used applications** to possible attack surfaces
- Understand **data flow in applications** and identify attack points
- Present findings in a **well-documented and structured format**

## 📘 Topics Covered

### 🔐 CIA Triad
- Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
- Real-world examples from:
  - Banking applications
  - Social media platforms

### 🧑‍💻 Threat Actors
- Script Kiddies  
- Insiders  
- Hacktivists  
- Nation-State Actors  

### 🎯 Attack Surface Analysis
- Web applications  
- Mobile applications  
- APIs  
- Networks  
- Cloud infrastructure  

### 🚨 OWASP Top 10
- Injection  
- Broken Authentication  
- Sensitive Data Exposure  
- Security Misconfiguration  
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- Broken Access Control  
- Insecure Deserialization  
- Using Vulnerable Components  
- Insufficient Logging & Monitoring  
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)  

### 🔁 Application Data Flow
- User → Application → Server → Database
- Identification of attack points at each stage

---

## 🛠 Tools & Resources Used
- **Browser (Chrome)** for research
- **GeeksforGeeks** for conceptual reference and understanding fundamentals  
- **OWASP Official Documentation** for vulnerability insights
- **AI Doc Maker** for structuring and refining documentation using prompts
- **GitHub** for version control and submission


---

## 🤖 AI Doc Maker Usage
AI Doc Maker was used to **refine and organize the content** after self-research.

### Sample Prompts Used:
- *“Explain the CIA Triad with real-world banking and social media examples in simple but professional language.”*
- *“Describe OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities from a SOC analyst perspective.”*
- *“Explain application data flow and identify possible attack points.”*
- *“Rewrite technical content to sound clear, structured, and internship-ready.”*

AI was used as a **supporting tool**, not as a replacement for learning.

- `README.md`

---

## ✅ Learning Outcome
Through this task, I developed:
- Strong conceptual clarity in cybersecurity fundamentals
- Awareness of real-world attack scenarios
- Understanding of how vulnerabilities impact applications
- Ability to document technical concepts clearly and professionally
